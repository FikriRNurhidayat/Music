I'll put my project's result here, in case you wonder how I am on music. Well, some of them might be Well-Mastered or Really-Bad-Mastered. Enjoy.

## Cats Under The Rain EP
Do you want to hear some sad story from this EP? Well, song with title "Cats Under The Rain" is actually based on my circle and my cats. And bad things happened on that specific object. 
First, my circle had broken and maybe died, because one of my friend being gay and absolutely being a toxic. I mean you can be gay, but don't forget your friends. We're welcoming you, but your BF behavior really made us mad.
Second, I lost my cats. Not actually lost them. But, I threw them away, like, in the middle of the rain, dude. She and her children, out there, even at the first they weren't together because she jumped from my bike and I left her. Not on my will, but my father's will. I knew that my dad was angry so bad, because he was hungry that time, and my cat ate his food. But again, I still can't move on until now.
